 Apache Installation
 Install Apache: Used the `yum` package manager to install the `httpd` package:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y httpd
   ```
3. Start Apache Service: After the installation, I started the Apache service and ensured it was set to start on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start httpd
   sudo systemctl enable httpd
   ```
4. Verify Installation: Confirmed that Apache was running by accessing the server's IP address from a web browser, which displayed the default Apache CentOS test page.

Firewall Configuration
1.Open HTTP and HTTPS Ports: To allow web traffic, I added rules to the firewall for ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS):
   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
   ```
2. Reload Firewall: Applied the changes by reloading the firewall:
   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```
3. Check Firewall Settings: Ensured the services were added successfully:
   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
   ```
