Steps of DHCP:

Discovery:
Client broadcasts DHCPDISCOVER to find DHCP servers.
Uses broadcast address; client has no IP yet.

Offer:
DHCP servers respond with DHCPOFFER, offering IP configurations.
Each offer includes IP address, subnet mask, lease duration, etc.

Request:
Client selects an offer and broadcasts DHCPREQUEST to accept it.
Informs chosen server of acceptance and others to retract their offers.

Acknowledgment:
Chosen DHCP server sends DHCPACK, confirming IP lease to the client.
Includes lease duration and necessary network configuration details.
